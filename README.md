# Usability-Enhancement-Project-Fragrance.net-Redesign

In this project, my team identified usability issues in the fragrance.net website and embarked on a mission to optimize  its user experience.

• Leveraging principles such as CLT, Usability, UX, and User-centered design, I designed and implemented a prototype
using Axure RP 10. The prototype aimed to address identified usability problems and improve the overall design flow, 
particularly focusing on e-commerce functionality.

• Two specific tasks were identified for enhancement, and the redesigned prototype was rigorously tested against the 
original website using common usability metrics. The project involved a comprehensive usability test, ensuring that the 
new design aligned with established principles and theories covered in class.
